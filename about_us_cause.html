       <h4>"I’m too fat. My legs are too short. If only I fit into a size 3; then I’d be happy. Or if my nose was smaller I’d go out more." Does any of this sound familiar to you? In today’s society there are so many misconceptions about how a body should be that sometimes you may feel lost inside yourself. The media would have us believe that in order to fit into and be accepted among your peers you need to be ultra thin, gorgeous, and never eat. </h4>
        <h1>About Us</h1>
         <p><h4>Body Magicians is a campaigning organization of volunteers who believe that our body is unique and has its own beauty. We find its important to fight against image misconceptions.

Our goal is to help everyone feel great about themselves and have a healthy self esteem. Only in that case we will live in a healthy society and most importantly we will be able to save millions of lives.<h4>
